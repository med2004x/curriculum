# Lesson 080 Work Packet

**Lecture:** [`README.md`](README.md)  
**Module:** 9. Security, Database Internals, and Distributed Systems  
**Primary:** Security/Linux/Production  
**Session target:** 2–4 hours  

This file is the practical half of the lesson. Do the lecture first. Do not treat the worked examples in the lecture as evidence that you can reproduce the skill from memory.

## 1. Session sequence

Use this exact order: **retrieve → guided practice → independent exercises → problem solving → coding challenge → review → evidence**. Skip a phase only when you have already demonstrated mastery of the lesson gate.

Suggested pacing: 10–15 min retrieval, 25–45 min guided practice, 45–75 min exercises, 30–60 min problem solving, 60–120 min challenge, 15 min review.

## 2. Retrieve before learning

1. Which kernel is ordinarily shared by containers on one host?
2. What resource views do namespaces isolate?
3. What do cgroups account for or limit?
4. How do capabilities refine root privilege?
5. What does an image digest identify?
6. What do SBOM and provenance records establish, and what remains unproven?

Do not open the lecture until the predictions are written. Retrieval is not warm-up decoration. It is part of the lesson.

## 3. Guided practice

### Practice A — Predict
1. Predict process visibility inside and outside a PID namespace.
2. Predict which interfaces differ under host networking.
3. Predict the effect of dropping one Linux capability.
4. Predict what a read-only root filesystem prevents and what mounted volumes still permit.
5. Predict which image input a digest pins.
6. Predict what an SBOM reports and what it does not prove.
7. Predict whether a configuration flag proves an operation is actually denied.
8. State the shared-kernel boundary in a container.

Run the smallest case first. Record prediction and observation side by side.

### Practice B — Modify one variable
Take the smallest runnable example from the lecture and change exactly one thing. Do not add new concepts yet. Predict the change, run it, and explain the delta in one paragraph.

### Practice C — Guided instrumentation
Instrument one internal state: an index, pointer, counter, transaction state, request ID, queue length, timestamp, or equivalent. The instrumentation must let you answer “what changed?” rather than merely “did it work?”

## 4. Independent exercises

### Exercise 1 — Recall and prediction
Without running anything, explain the main mechanism in **Distinguish container namespaces/cgroups from a virtual machine's separate guest kernel.**. Predict the result for one ordinary input and one boundary input. Record both predictions before checking them.

### Exercise 2 — Guided-to-independent implementation
Rebuild the smallest useful version of the lesson's main mechanism from a blank file. Your implementation must satisfy **Inspect process, network, mount, and capability boundaries in a container.**. Start with a written data/control-flow sketch, then code, then verify.

### Exercise 3 — Debug and repair
Take your implementation and introduce one realistic defect: wrong boundary, wrong state update, missing cleanup, incorrect error branch, or invalid assumption. Reproduce the failure, classify it, fix it, and add a regression test or evidence step.

### Exercise 4 — Transfer
Change one important constraint from the lesson. Examples: larger input, partial failure, concurrent callers, invalid data, persistence, or a different representation. Explain which invariant survives, which one changes, and why.

### Exercise 5 — Explanation
Write a 150–250 word technical explanation of **Apply least-privilege runtime settings and verify the denied operation.** as if another student must implement it from your explanation. No screenshots; the explanation must stand on its own.

## 5. Problem-solving lab

Assume an attacker controls one untrusted input or one lower-trust component. Identify the trust boundary, attacker goal, violated invariant, and smallest preventive control. Verify the control with a test.

### Problem-solving protocol

1. Restate the problem and constraints.
2. Produce a small concrete example.
3. State the invariant or contract.
4. Write the simplest baseline solution or model.
5. Identify the bottleneck, failure, or repeated work.
6. Improve it only after you can explain the baseline.
7. Verify against a case designed to break the naive solution.

## 6. Coding challenge

### Supply-chain boundary

Harden a containerized build against dependency and privilege risks. Record the changed attack surface and verify the build remains reproducible.

### Acceptance criteria

- The main path works on normal input.
- At least two boundary or invalid cases are tested.
- One failure mode is deliberately reproduced and then fixed.
- The implementation can be explained from a blank page in terms of state and invariants.
- Verification is reproducible from commands recorded in your evidence file.

## 8. Debugging and failure lab

1. Take a capability-dropped, non-root container from steps 3-4 and attempt an operation that *should* be prevented by your restricted configuration but that you suspect might still be possible due to some capability or permission you didn't think to drop (e.g.

2. If you find something still works that shouldn't, given your intended security posture, identify specifically what additional restriction (a more limited volume mount, an additional dropped capability, a read-only root filesystem via `--read-only`) would be needed, and apply it.

3. Explain why this kind of "test what you think is restricted, don't just configure and assume" verification step is necessary — configuring capability drops and namespaces correctly is easy to get subtly wrong, and only actually testing the specific operations you intend to prevent (not just checking that the configuration flags are present) gives real confid.

4. Reproduce the failure from a clean terminal session and write the smallest change that returns the system to the expected contract.

Rule: never fix a failure by changing multiple unrelated things at once. The objective is diagnosis, not ritual.

## 9. Transfer and design reasoning

Change exactly one constraint in the main case for # 080 — Isolation, Containers, and Supply Chain: change the input shape, data size, interface, or operating condition without changing the underlying objective. Solve it from blank, then verify the new behavior with a terminal command or a reproducible calculation.

Your transfer answer is complete only when the changed constraint is explicit and the evidence distinguishes the new case from the original case.

Then answer: **What would make your current solution wrong even though all visible examples still pass?**

## 10. Academic drill

1. **Contract recall:** State the protocol/API/security rule without notes.
2. **Scenario analysis:** Given one malformed or adversarial request, determine the expected system response.
3. **Why:** Explain the invariant or security property that makes that response correct.
4. **Implementation bridge:** Name the test or runtime observation that would prove the rule is enforced.

## 11. Self-test

- [ ] Which kernel is ordinarily shared by containers on one host?
- [ ] What resource views do namespaces isolate?
- [ ] What do cgroups account for or limit?
- [ ] How do capabilities refine root privilege?
- [ ] What does an image digest identify?
- [ ] What do SBOM and provenance records establish, and what remains unproven?

Score yourself only after the attempt: **0 = cannot answer, 1 = answer with notes, 2 = answer from memory, 3 = answer and justify a new variation.**

## 12. Evidence and grading

Create `EVIDENCE.md` in this lesson directory. Record:

- the exact commands or test commands used;
- one before/after prediction;
- one failure reproduced deliberately and its diagnosis;
- the result of the coding challenge;
- one transfer variation;
- your self-test score.

### Gate rubric

| Dimension | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Knowledge | Explain the core model without notes. |
| Procedure | Produce a working implementation or derivation from blank. |
| Debugging | Reproduce, classify, and repair one realistic failure. |
| Transfer | Solve a changed constraint without being handed the algorithm. |
| Evidence | Another person can reproduce the verification from your notes. |

Suggested pass threshold: all five dimensions pass. If one fails, review that dimension before moving to the next lesson.

## 13. Mastery gate

Use the lecture's mastery gate in [`README.md`](README.md) as the primary criterion. This work packet adds the stronger requirement that you can satisfy the gate **after** completing independent work, not by recognising the lecture examples.

For integrated assessment lessons, the gate is summative: treat the challenge as an exam/project submission and do not consult previous solutions while working.

## 14. Spaced review

- **Next day:** answer the self-test from memory and redo one exercise without looking.
- **One week:** solve the transfer problem again under a changed constraint.
- **Later module review:** revisit this lesson when the concept reappears in a later module and compare the old and new evidence.

## 15. External practice reference

- Use the lesson's assigned material and primary technical documentation when a precise semantic detail needs verification. The repository challenge remains the assessment artifact.
