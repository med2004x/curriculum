# Lesson 070 Work Packet

**Lecture:** [`README.md`](README.md)  
**Module:** 8. Backend Engineering  
**Primary:** API/Performance/Math  
**Session target:** 2–4 hours  

This file is the practical half of the lesson. Do the lecture first. Do not treat the worked examples in the lecture as evidence that you can reproduce the skill from memory.

## 1. Session sequence

Use this exact order: **retrieve → guided practice → independent exercises → problem solving → coding challenge → review → evidence**. Skip a phase only when you have already demonstrated mastery of the lesson gate.

Suggested pacing: 10–15 min retrieval, 25–45 min guided practice, 45–75 min exercises, 30–60 min problem solving, 60–120 min challenge, 15 min review.

## 2. Retrieve before learning

1. What does bucket capacity control?
2. What does refill rate control?
3. Why can fixed windows allow boundary bursts?
4. What limiter key is appropriate for authenticated API clients?
5. Why are process-local limits insufficient across replicas?
6. What does `Retry-After` communicate?

Do not open the lecture until the predictions are written. Retrieval is not warm-up decoration. It is part of the lesson.

## 3. Guided practice

### Practice A — Predict
1. Predict the bucket balance after a burst and elapsed refill interval.
2. Predict fixed-window allowance for requests straddling a boundary.
3. Predict what happens when a token bucket reaches capacity during idle time.
4. Predict how two users behind one NAT interact with an IP-only key.
5. Predict what changes when limiter state is local to each service replica.
6. Predict which metadata helps a client retry responsibly.
7. Predict the risk of trusting a client-supplied forwarding header directly.
8. State the atomicity requirement for simultaneous requests using one key.

Run the smallest case first. Record prediction and observation side by side.

### Practice B — Modify one variable
Take the smallest runnable example from the lecture and change exactly one thing. Do not add new concepts yet. Predict the change, run it, and explain the delta in one paragraph.

### Practice C — Guided instrumentation
Instrument one internal state: an index, pointer, counter, transaction state, request ID, queue length, timestamp, or equivalent. The instrumentation must let you answer “what changed?” rather than merely “did it work?”

## 4. Independent exercises

### Exercise 1 — Recall and prediction
Without running anything, explain the main mechanism in **Implement and compare fixed-window and token-bucket rate limiters.**. Predict the result for one ordinary input and one boundary input. Record both predictions before checking them.

### Exercise 2 — Guided-to-independent implementation
Rebuild the smallest useful version of the lesson's main mechanism from a blank file. Your implementation must satisfy **Define the rate-limit key and explain how identity, IP, and shared proxies affect fairness.**. Start with a written data/control-flow sketch, then code, then verify.

### Exercise 3 — Debug and repair
Take your implementation and introduce one realistic defect: wrong boundary, wrong state update, missing cleanup, incorrect error branch, or invalid assumption. Reproduce the failure, classify it, fix it, and add a regression test or evidence step.

### Exercise 4 — Transfer
Change one important constraint from the lesson. Examples: larger input, partial failure, concurrent callers, invalid data, persistence, or a different representation. Explain which invariant survives, which one changes, and why.

### Exercise 5 — Explanation
Write a 150–250 word technical explanation of **Return useful limit/reset metadata without leaking sensitive identity data.** as if another student must implement it from your explanation. No screenshots; the explanation must stand on its own.

## 5. Problem-solving lab

You are given a small specification with two valid states and one invalid state. Decompose it into inputs, invariant, transition, and verification before writing code.

### Problem-solving protocol

1. Restate the problem and constraints.
2. Produce a small concrete example.
3. State the invariant or contract.
4. Write the simplest baseline solution or model.
5. Identify the bottleneck, failure, or repeated work.
6. Improve it only after you can explain the baseline.
7. Verify against a case designed to break the naive solution.

## 6. Coding challenge

### Rate-limit + cache

Add a bounded rate limiter and a cache to a small HTTP service. Measure hit rate and rejection behavior, then document the consistency trade-off.

### Acceptance criteria

- The main path works on normal input.
- At least two boundary or invalid cases are tested.
- One failure mode is deliberately reproduced and then fixed.
- The implementation can be explained from a blank page in terms of state and invariants.
- Verification is reproducible from commands recorded in your evidence file.

## 8. Debugging and failure lab

1. Key by client IP and show two users behind one NAT consuming the same allowance.

2. Switch to authenticated identity/API key and compare per-principal fairness while retaining an IP-level abuse safeguard if required.

3. Explain why forwarding headers must come only from explicitly trusted proxies.

4. Reproduce the failure from a clean terminal session and write the smallest change that returns the system to the expected contract.

Rule: never fix a failure by changing multiple unrelated things at once. The objective is diagnosis, not ritual.

## 9. Transfer and design reasoning

Change one policy: use an authenticated principal plus route rather than IP, or lower the bucket capacity while keeping refill rate fixed. Recompute the burst allowance and discuss fairness/capacity.

Your transfer answer is complete only when the changed constraint is explicit and the evidence distinguishes the new case from the original case.

Then answer: **What would make your current solution wrong even though all visible examples still pass?**

## 10. Academic drill

1. **Contract recall:** State the protocol/API/security rule without notes.
2. **Scenario analysis:** Given one malformed or adversarial request, determine the expected system response.
3. **Why:** Explain the invariant or security property that makes that response correct.
4. **Implementation bridge:** Name the test or runtime observation that would prove the rule is enforced.

This lesson is also an academic integration point. Do the written drill before the engineering implementation so the two reinforce each other rather than becoming two unrelated memorisation exercises.

## 11. Self-test

- [ ] What does bucket capacity control?
- [ ] What does refill rate control?
- [ ] Why can fixed windows allow boundary bursts?
- [ ] What limiter key is appropriate for authenticated API clients?
- [ ] Why are process-local limits insufficient across replicas?
- [ ] What does `Retry-After` communicate?

Score yourself only after the attempt: **0 = cannot answer, 1 = answer with notes, 2 = answer from memory, 3 = answer and justify a new variation.**

## 12. Evidence and grading

Create `EVIDENCE.md` in this lesson directory. Record:

- the exact commands or test commands used;
- one before/after prediction;
- one failure reproduced deliberately and its diagnosis;
- the result of the coding challenge;
- one transfer variation;
- your self-test score.

### Gate rubric

| Dimension | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Knowledge | Explain the core model without notes. |
| Procedure | Produce a working implementation or derivation from blank. |
| Debugging | Reproduce, classify, and repair one realistic failure. |
| Transfer | Solve a changed constraint without being handed the algorithm. |
| Evidence | Another person can reproduce the verification from your notes. |

Suggested pass threshold: all five dimensions pass. If one fails, review that dimension before moving to the next lesson.

## 13. Mastery gate

Use the lecture's mastery gate in [`README.md`](README.md) as the primary criterion. This work packet adds the stronger requirement that you can satisfy the gate **after** completing independent work, not by recognising the lecture examples.

For integrated assessment lessons, the gate is summative: treat the challenge as an exam/project submission and do not consult previous solutions while working.

## 14. Spaced review

- **Next day:** answer the self-test from memory and redo one exercise without looking.
- **One week:** solve the transfer problem again under a changed constraint.
- **Later module review:** revisit this lesson when the concept reappears in a later module and compare the old and new evidence.

## 15. External practice reference

- Use the lesson's assigned material and primary technical documentation when a precise semantic detail needs verification. The repository challenge remains the assessment artifact.
