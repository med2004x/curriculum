# Lesson 088 Work Packet

**Lecture:** [`README.md`](README.md)  
**Module:** 9. Security, Database Internals, and Distributed Systems  
**Primary:** Distributed/Math  
**Session target:** 2–4 hours  

This file is the practical half of the lesson. Do the lecture first. Do not treat the worked examples in the lecture as evidence that you can reproduce the skill from memory.

## 1. Session sequence

Use this exact order: **retrieve → guided practice → independent exercises → problem solving → coding challenge → review → evidence**. Skip a phase only when you have already demonstrated mastery of the lesson gate.

Suggested pacing: 10–15 min retrieval, 25–45 min guided practice, 45–75 min exercises, 30–60 min problem solving, 60–120 min challenge, 15 min review.

## 2. Retrieve before learning

1. What is the main objective stated for # 088 — Clocks, Ordering, and Logical Time?
2. What two concrete practices are required in the assigned material for # 088 — Clocks, Ordering, and Logical Time?
3. What does the lesson ask you to reproduce before making changes?
4. What failure mode is explicitly used as a diagnostic exercise?
5. What evidence does the verification step require you to record?
6. What condition in the "Done when" criterion proves mastery of this lesson?

Do not open the lecture until the predictions are written. Retrieval is not warm-up decoration. It is part of the lesson.

## 3. Guided practice

### Practice A — Predict
1. Predict the local timestamp after a local event.
2. Predict the timestamp after receiving remote time `t`.
3. Does `L(a) < L(b)` prove that `a` happened before `b`?
4. Identify concurrent events in two independent processes.
5. Predict how synthetic clock offset changes wall-clock ordering.
6. State the causal guarantee Lamport clocks preserve.
7. State what additional information vector clocks provide.
8. Distinguish logical order from elapsed-time measurement.

Run the smallest case first. Record prediction and observation side by side.

### Practice B — Modify one variable
Take the smallest runnable example from the lecture and change exactly one thing. Do not add new concepts yet. Predict the change, run it, and explain the delta in one paragraph.

### Practice C — Guided instrumentation
Instrument one internal state: an index, pointer, counter, transaction state, request ID, queue length, timestamp, or equivalent. The instrumentation must let you answer “what changed?” rather than merely “did it work?”

## 4. Independent exercises

### Exercise 1 — Recall and prediction
Without running anything, explain the main mechanism in **Define happened-before for process-local events and message send/receive.**. Predict the result for one ordinary input and one boundary input. Record both predictions before checking them.

### Exercise 2 — Guided-to-independent implementation
Rebuild the smallest useful version of the lesson's main mechanism from a blank file. Your implementation must satisfy **Implement Lamport `tick` and `receive` updates and verify causal ordering.**. Start with a written data/control-flow sketch, then code, then verify.

### Exercise 3 — Debug and repair
Take your implementation and introduce one realistic defect: wrong boundary, wrong state update, missing cleanup, incorrect error branch, or invalid assumption. Reproduce the failure, classify it, fix it, and add a regression test or evidence step.

### Exercise 4 — Transfer
Change one important constraint from the lesson. Examples: larger input, partial failure, concurrent callers, invalid data, persistence, or a different representation. Explain which invariant survives, which one changes, and why.

### Exercise 5 — Explanation
Write a 150–250 word technical explanation of **Explain why Lamport timestamps do not identify concurrent events or measure physical time.** as if another student must implement it from your explanation. No screenshots; the explanation must stand on its own.

## 5. Problem-solving lab

Assume messages can be delayed, duplicated, or lost. State the guarantees you need, then design the minimum protocol state required to preserve them.

### Problem-solving protocol

1. Restate the problem and constraints.
2. Produce a small concrete example.
3. State the invariant or contract.
4. Write the simplest baseline solution or model.
5. Identify the bottleneck, failure, or repeated work.
6. Improve it only after you can explain the baseline.
7. Verify against a case designed to break the naive solution.

## 6. Coding challenge

### Logical ordering

Implement Lamport-style logical timestamps or another explicit ordering mechanism and demonstrate how concurrent events become comparable.

### Acceptance criteria

- The main path works on normal input.
- At least two boundary or invalid cases are tested.
- One failure mode is deliberately reproduced and then fixed.
- The implementation can be explained from a blank page in terms of state and invariants.
- Verification is reproducible from commands recorded in your evidence file.

## 8. Debugging and failure lab

1. Modify your step 2 simulation to also record and print each event's *wall-clock* timestamp (using each process's own local system clock, `time.Now()` or equivalent) alongside its Lamport timestamp — and, to make the failure concrete rather than requiring naturally-occurring clock drift, deliberately introduce a synthetic clock offset for one of your simulate.

2. Construct a scenario where process A sends a message to process B (A's send genuinely, causally precedes B's receive), but due to your artificial clock skew, B's wall-clock-timestamped receive event shows an *earlier* wall-clock time than A's send event — while the Lamport timestamps for the same two events correctly still show the send before the receive.

3. Explain, using this concrete, deliberately-constructed contradiction, exactly why wall-clock ordering failed here specifically (clock skew) while Lamport ordering didn't (it never depends on wall-clock values at all, only on the message-passing structure itself).

4. Reproduce the failure from a clean terminal session and write the smallest change that returns the system to the expected contract.

Rule: never fix a failure by changing multiple unrelated things at once. The objective is diagnosis, not ritual.

## 9. Transfer and design reasoning

Change exactly one constraint in the main case for # 088 — Clocks, Ordering, and Logical Time: change the input shape, data size, interface, or operating condition without changing the underlying objective. Solve it from blank, then verify the new behavior with a terminal command or a reproducible calculation.

Your transfer answer is complete only when the changed constraint is explicit and the evidence distinguishes the new case from the original case.

Then answer: **What would make your current solution wrong even though all visible examples still pass?**

## 10. Academic drill

1. **Model:** State the system model and assumptions before solving.
2. **Trace:** Work a small failure or state-transition example by hand.
3. **Trade-off:** Compare two designs and state the condition under which each wins.
4. **Evidence:** Identify the measurement, test, or trace that would distinguish the designs in practice.

This lesson is also an academic integration point. Do the written drill before the engineering implementation so the two reinforce each other rather than becoming two unrelated memorisation exercises.

## 11. Self-test

- [ ] What is the main objective stated for # 088 — Clocks, Ordering, and Logical Time?
- [ ] What two concrete practices are required in the assigned material for # 088 — Clocks, Ordering, and Logical Time?
- [ ] What does the lesson ask you to reproduce before making changes?
- [ ] What failure mode is explicitly used as a diagnostic exercise?
- [ ] What evidence does the verification step require you to record?
- [ ] What condition in the "Done when" criterion proves mastery of this lesson?

Score yourself only after the attempt: **0 = cannot answer, 1 = answer with notes, 2 = answer from memory, 3 = answer and justify a new variation.**

## 12. Evidence and grading

Create `EVIDENCE.md` in this lesson directory. Record:

- the exact commands or test commands used;
- one before/after prediction;
- one failure reproduced deliberately and its diagnosis;
- the result of the coding challenge;
- one transfer variation;
- your self-test score.

### Gate rubric

| Dimension | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Knowledge | Explain the core model without notes. |
| Procedure | Produce a working implementation or derivation from blank. |
| Debugging | Reproduce, classify, and repair one realistic failure. |
| Transfer | Solve a changed constraint without being handed the algorithm. |
| Evidence | Another person can reproduce the verification from your notes. |

Suggested pass threshold: all five dimensions pass. If one fails, review that dimension before moving to the next lesson.

## 13. Mastery gate

Use the lecture's mastery gate in [`README.md`](README.md) as the primary criterion. This work packet adds the stronger requirement that you can satisfy the gate **after** completing independent work, not by recognising the lecture examples.

For integrated assessment lessons, the gate is summative: treat the challenge as an exam/project submission and do not consult previous solutions while working.

## 14. Spaced review

- **Next day:** answer the self-test from memory and redo one exercise without looking.
- **One week:** solve the transfer problem again under a changed constraint.
- **Later module review:** revisit this lesson when the concept reappears in a later module and compare the old and new evidence.

## 15. External practice reference

- Use the lesson's assigned material and primary technical documentation when a precise semantic detail needs verification. The repository challenge remains the assessment artifact.
