# Lesson 054 Work Packet

**Lecture:** [`README.md`](README.md)  
**Module:** 6. PostgreSQL and Durable Data  
**Primary:** Databases/OS  
**Session target:** 2–4 hours  

This file is the practical half of the lesson. Do the lecture first. Do not treat the worked examples in the lecture as evidence that you can reproduce the skill from memory.

## 1. Session sequence

Use this exact order: **retrieve → guided practice → independent exercises → problem solving → coding challenge → review → evidence**. Skip a phase only when you have already demonstrated mastery of the lesson gate.

Suggested pacing: 10–15 min retrieval, 25–45 min guided practice, 45–75 min exercises, 30–60 min problem solving, 60–120 min challenge, 15 min review.

## 2. Retrieve before learning

1. What visibility does MVCC provide to a transaction?
2. How does Read Committed snapshot behavior differ from Repeatable Read?
3. What does `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` protect?
4. How does consistent lock ordering prevent a particular deadlock?
5. What is a serialization failure and what should be retried?
6. Why should a transaction be short?

Do not open the lecture until the predictions are written. Retrieval is not warm-up decoration. It is part of the lesson.

## 3. Guided practice

### Practice A — Predict
1. Predict whether a second `FOR UPDATE` on the same row proceeds immediately or waits.
2. Predict what a Read Committed statement sees after another transaction commits.
3. Predict what Repeatable Read preserves across statements in one transaction.
4. Predict what happens when Serializable detects a non-serializable execution.
5. Predict the partial state after a transfer transaction rolls back.
6. Predict how opposite row-lock order can deadlock.
7. Predict how ascending ID order changes the wait-for cycle.
8. State which errors the application may retry and why retries must be bounded.

Run the smallest case first. Record prediction and observation side by side.

### Practice B — Modify one variable
Take the smallest runnable example from the lecture and change exactly one thing. Do not add new concepts yet. Predict the change, run it, and explain the delta in one paragraph.

### Practice C — Guided instrumentation
Instrument one internal state: an index, pointer, counter, transaction state, request ID, queue length, timestamp, or equivalent. The instrumentation must let you answer “what changed?” rather than merely “did it work?”

## 4. Independent exercises

### Exercise 1 — Recall and prediction
Without running anything, explain the main mechanism in **Explain how PostgreSQL MVCC gives statements and transactions snapshots of row versions.**. Predict the result for one ordinary input and one boundary input. Record both predictions before checking them.

### Exercise 2 — Guided-to-independent implementation
Rebuild the smallest useful version of the lesson's main mechanism from a blank file. Your implementation must satisfy **Compare the practical visibility guarantees of Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable.**. Start with a written data/control-flow sketch, then code, then verify.

### Exercise 3 — Debug and repair
Take your implementation and introduce one realistic defect: wrong boundary, wrong state update, missing cleanup, incorrect error branch, or invalid assumption. Reproduce the failure, classify it, fix it, and add a regression test or evidence step.

### Exercise 4 — Transfer
Change one important constraint from the lesson. Examples: larger input, partial failure, concurrent callers, invalid data, persistence, or a different representation. Explain which invariant survives, which one changes, and why.

### Exercise 5 — Explanation
Write a 150–250 word technical explanation of **Use row locks or atomic SQL updates to protect a concurrent state transition.** as if another student must implement it from your explanation. No screenshots; the explanation must stand on its own.

## 5. Problem-solving lab

Assume an attacker controls one untrusted input or one lower-trust component. Identify the trust boundary, attacker goal, violated invariant, and smallest preventive control. Verify the control with a test.

### Problem-solving protocol

1. Restate the problem and constraints.
2. Produce a small concrete example.
3. State the invariant or contract.
4. Write the simplest baseline solution or model.
5. Identify the bottleneck, failure, or repeated work.
6. Improve it only after you can explain the baseline.
7. Verify against a case designed to break the naive solution.

## 6. Coding challenge

### Isolation experiment

Open concurrent transactions and reproduce a chosen isolation phenomenon. Record the exact schedule and explain which guarantee prevented or allowed it.

### Acceptance criteria

- The main path works on normal input.
- At least two boundary or invalid cases are tested.
- One failure mode is deliberately reproduced and then fixed.
- The implementation can be explained from a blank page in terms of state and invariants.
- Verification is reproducible from commands recorded in your evidence file.

## 8. Debugging and failure lab

1. Construct the opposite-order row-lock deadlock and identify the wait-for cycle.

2. Apply ascending key order and explain why both transactions now request rows consistently.

3. Create a serialization conflict and document the correct whole-transaction retry boundary.

4. Reproduce the failure from a clean terminal session and write the smallest change that returns the system to the expected contract.

Rule: never fix a failure by changing multiple unrelated things at once. The objective is diagnosis, not ritual.

## 9. Transfer and design reasoning

Change one transaction property: run the operation at a different isolation level or add a third account row. Explain which snapshots, locks, and retry outcomes may change.

Your transfer answer is complete only when the changed constraint is explicit and the evidence distinguishes the new case from the original case.

Then answer: **What would make your current solution wrong even though all visible examples still pass?**

## 10. Academic drill

1. **Formal model:** State the relevant relation, invariant, transaction property, or storage rule.
2. **Schedule/table:** Work one small example manually.
3. **Counterexample:** Construct one invalid or surprising case.
4. **Verification:** State the SQL command, trace, or test that would falsify your answer.

## 11. Self-test

- [ ] What visibility does MVCC provide to a transaction?
- [ ] How does Read Committed snapshot behavior differ from Repeatable Read?
- [ ] What does `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` protect?
- [ ] How does consistent lock ordering prevent a particular deadlock?
- [ ] What is a serialization failure and what should be retried?
- [ ] Why should a transaction be short?

Score yourself only after the attempt: **0 = cannot answer, 1 = answer with notes, 2 = answer from memory, 3 = answer and justify a new variation.**

## 12. Evidence and grading

Create `EVIDENCE.md` in this lesson directory. Record:

- the exact commands or test commands used;
- one before/after prediction;
- one failure reproduced deliberately and its diagnosis;
- the result of the coding challenge;
- one transfer variation;
- your self-test score.

### Gate rubric

| Dimension | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Knowledge | Explain the core model without notes. |
| Procedure | Produce a working implementation or derivation from blank. |
| Debugging | Reproduce, classify, and repair one realistic failure. |
| Transfer | Solve a changed constraint without being handed the algorithm. |
| Evidence | Another person can reproduce the verification from your notes. |

Suggested pass threshold: all five dimensions pass. If one fails, review that dimension before moving to the next lesson.

## 13. Mastery gate

Use the lecture's mastery gate in [`README.md`](README.md) as the primary criterion. This work packet adds the stronger requirement that you can satisfy the gate **after** completing independent work, not by recognising the lecture examples.

For integrated assessment lessons, the gate is summative: treat the challenge as an exam/project submission and do not consult previous solutions while working.

## 14. Spaced review

- **Next day:** answer the self-test from memory and redo one exercise without looking.
- **One week:** solve the transfer problem again under a changed constraint.
- **Later module review:** revisit this lesson when the concept reappears in a later module and compare the old and new evidence.

## 15. External practice reference

- Use the lesson's assigned material and primary technical documentation when a precise semantic detail needs verification. The repository challenge remains the assessment artifact.
