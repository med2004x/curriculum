# Lesson 040 Work Packet

**Lecture:** [`README.md`](README.md)  
**Module:** 4. Go and Core Algorithms  
**Primary:** Go/Algorithms/Communication  
**Session target:** 3–6 hours  

This file is the practical half of the lesson. Do the lecture first. Do not treat the worked examples in the lecture as evidence that you can reproduce the skill from memory.

## 1. Session sequence

Use this exact order: **retrieve → guided practice → independent exercises → problem solving → coding challenge → review → evidence**. Skip a phase only when you have already demonstrated mastery of the lesson gate.

Suggested pacing: 10–15 min retrieval, 25–45 min guided practice, 45–75 min exercises, 30–60 min problem solving, 60–120 min challenge, 15 min review.

## 2. Retrieve before learning

1. What are the input-validation errors distinct from graph cycles?
2. How does Kahn's algorithm construct a topological order?
3. How does the algorithm detect a cycle?
4. How is earliest finish computed from prerequisites?
5. What is the time complexity in terms of vertices and edges?
6. How does the critical path differ from a topological order?

Do not open the lecture until the predictions are written. Retrieval is not warm-up decoration. It is part of the lesson.

## 3. Guided practice

### Practice A — Predict
1. Predict the earliest finish for each task in the four-task example.
2. Predict the number of vertices emitted after adding a back-edge from D to A.
3. Predict how Kahn's algorithm identifies that not all tasks can be ordered.
4. Predict the result of an unknown prerequisite ID.
5. Predict the result of duplicate task IDs.
6. Predict the asymptotic time when the task graph has `V` vertices and `E` edges.
7. Distinguish an arbitrary valid topological order from the critical path duration.
8. Draft the one-sentence conclusion before writing the technical explanation.

Run the smallest case first. Record prediction and observation side by side.

### Practice B — Modify one variable
Take the smallest runnable example from the lecture and change exactly one thing. Do not add new concepts yet. Predict the change, run it, and explain the delta in one paragraph.

### Practice C — Guided instrumentation
Instrument one internal state: an index, pointer, counter, transaction state, request ID, queue length, timestamp, or equivalent. The instrumentation must let you answer “what changed?” rather than merely “did it work?”

## 4. Independent exercises

### Exercise 1 — Recall and prediction
Without running anything, explain the main mechanism in **Implement a dependency planner that validates tasks and orders a directed acyclic graph.**. Predict the result for one ordinary input and one boundary input. Record both predictions before checking them.

### Exercise 2 — Guided-to-independent implementation
Rebuild the smallest useful version of the lesson's main mechanism from a blank file. Your implementation must satisfy **Detect cycles and explain why no valid dependency order exists for cyclic input.**. Start with a written data/control-flow sketch, then code, then verify.

### Exercise 3 — Debug and repair
Take your implementation and introduce one realistic defect: wrong boundary, wrong state update, missing cleanup, incorrect error branch, or invalid assumption. Reproduce the failure, classify it, fix it, and add a regression test or evidence step.

### Exercise 4 — Transfer
Change one important constraint from the lesson. Examples: larger input, partial failure, concurrent callers, invalid data, persistence, or a different representation. Explain which invariant survives, which one changes, and why.

### Exercise 5 — Explanation
Write a 150–250 word technical explanation of **Calculate the earliest completion time for each task when task durations are supplied.** as if another student must implement it from your explanation. No screenshots; the explanation must stand on its own.

## 5. Problem-solving lab

Solve an unseen problem by writing a brute-force baseline first. Then identify the repeated work or structure and derive a better approach. Compare both on the same examples.

### Problem-solving protocol

1. Restate the problem and constraints.
2. Produce a small concrete example.
3. State the invariant or contract.
4. Write the simplest baseline solution or model.
5. Identify the bottleneck, failure, or repeated work.
6. Improve it only after you can explain the baseline.
7. Verify against a case designed to break the naive solution.

## 6. Coding challenge

### Timed algorithms assessment

Solve a mixed algorithm assessment from a blank workspace under a fixed time budget. Include complexity analysis and one post-mortem on a failed attempt.

### Acceptance criteria

- Start from a clean workspace or the latest lesson project without copying a completed solution.
- Implement the required behavior end-to-end.
- Include automated tests where the technology allows it, plus one deliberate failure test.
- Record design assumptions and the main invariant(s) in Markdown.
- Demonstrate the project from a reproducible command sequence.
- Finish with a short post-mortem: what failed, why, and what you changed.

## 8. Debugging and failure lab

1. Add a cycle and demonstrate that no topological order can satisfy every prerequisite.

2. Add an unknown prerequisite and ensure it is reported as invalid input, not as a cycle.

3. Remove one verification step and record what evidence is lost.

4. Reproduce the failure from a clean terminal session and write the smallest change that returns the system to the expected contract.

Rule: never fix a failure by changing multiple unrelated things at once. The objective is diagnosis, not ritual.

## 9. Transfer and design reasoning

Change one constraint: allow zero-duration tasks, or add multiple independent start tasks. State whether graph ordering and earliest-finish recurrence still apply and update validation accordingly.

Your transfer answer is complete only when the changed constraint is explicit and the evidence distinguishes the new case from the original case.

Then answer: **What would make your current solution wrong even though all visible examples still pass?**

## 10. Academic drill

1. **Algorithm statement:** Write the input, output, invariant, and termination argument before coding.
2. **Dry run:** Solve one non-trivial example by hand and show each state change.
3. **Complexity:** Give worst-case time and extra-space bounds and justify them.
4. **Transfer:** Change one constraint and explain which part of the algorithm must change.

LIG support: [S1-MASTER](../S1/mastery_s1.py). Complete the linked subject-pack drill before the engineering implementation; keep the university derivation and code evidence as separate artifacts.

## 11. Self-test

- [ ] What are the input-validation errors distinct from graph cycles?
- [ ] How does Kahn's algorithm construct a topological order?
- [ ] How does the algorithm detect a cycle?
- [ ] How is earliest finish computed from prerequisites?
- [ ] What is the time complexity in terms of vertices and edges?
- [ ] How does the critical path differ from a topological order?

Score yourself only after the attempt: **0 = cannot answer, 1 = answer with notes, 2 = answer from memory, 3 = answer and justify a new variation.**

## 12. Evidence and grading

Create `EVIDENCE.md` in this lesson directory. Record:

- the exact commands or test commands used;
- one before/after prediction;
- one failure reproduced deliberately and its diagnosis;
- the result of the coding challenge;
- one transfer variation;
- your self-test score.

### Gate rubric

| Dimension | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Knowledge | Explain the core model without notes. |
| Procedure | Produce a working implementation or derivation from blank. |
| Debugging | Reproduce, classify, and repair one realistic failure. |
| Transfer | Solve a changed constraint without being handed the algorithm. |
| Evidence | Another person can reproduce the verification from your notes. |

Suggested pass threshold: all five dimensions pass. If one fails, review that dimension before moving to the next lesson.

## 13. Mastery gate

Use the lecture's mastery gate in [`README.md`](README.md) as the primary criterion. This work packet adds the stronger requirement that you can satisfy the gate **after** completing independent work, not by recognising the lecture examples.

For integrated assessment lessons, the gate is summative: treat the challenge as an exam/project submission and do not consult previous solutions while working.

## 14. Spaced review

- **Next day:** answer the self-test from memory and redo one exercise without looking.
- **One week:** solve the transfer problem again under a changed constraint.
- **Later module review:** revisit this lesson when the concept reappears in a later module and compare the old and new evidence.

## 15. External practice reference

- [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/): work its exercises only after attempting the repository exercise so the external solution path does not replace your own reasoning.
- [Exercism Go Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/go): select a concept-matched exercise for additional independent practice and use feedback after your own attempt.
- [Go documentation](https://go.dev/doc/): use the primary documentation when the lesson depends on exact language or standard-library semantics.
