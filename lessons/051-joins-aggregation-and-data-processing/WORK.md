# Lesson 051 Work Packet

**Lecture:** [`README.md`](README.md)  
**Module:** 6. PostgreSQL and Durable Data  
**Primary:** Databases/Algorithms  
**Session target:** 2–4 hours  

This file is the practical half of the lesson. Do the lecture first. Do not treat the worked examples in the lecture as evidence that you can reproduce the skill from memory.

## 1. Session sequence

Use this exact order: **retrieve → guided practice → independent exercises → problem solving → coding challenge → review → evidence**. Skip a phase only when you have already demonstrated mastery of the lesson gate.

Suggested pacing: 10–15 min retrieval, 25–45 min guided practice, 45–75 min exercises, 30–60 min problem solving, 60–120 min challenge, 15 min review.

## 2. Retrieve before learning

1. What does an inner join return?
2. How does a left join preserve unmatched rows?
3. How can a `WHERE` predicate null-reject a left-joined row?
4. What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?
5. How can a many-to-many join multiply counts?
6. When is `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` appropriate?

Do not open the lecture until the predictions are written. Retrieval is not warm-up decoration. It is part of the lesson.

## 3. Guided practice

### Practice A — Predict
1. Predict the output row count for a task with three tags under an inner join.
2. Predict whether a task with zero tags appears under a left join.
3. Predict how a predicate in `WHERE` changes NULL-extended rows.
4. State the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`.
5. Predict the result of `COUNT(*)` versus `COUNT(tag_id)` on a left join.
6. Predict when `COUNT(DISTINCT task_id)` differs from `COUNT(task_id)`.
7. Identify the grouping columns needed for one row per task.
8. State the expected cardinality before reading the query result.

Run the smallest case first. Record prediction and observation side by side.

### Practice B — Modify one variable
Take the smallest runnable example from the lecture and change exactly one thing. Do not add new concepts yet. Predict the change, run it, and explain the delta in one paragraph.

### Practice C — Guided instrumentation
Instrument one internal state: an index, pointer, counter, transaction state, request ID, queue length, timestamp, or equivalent. The instrumentation must let you answer “what changed?” rather than merely “did it work?”

## 4. Independent exercises

### Exercise 1 — Recall and prediction
Without running anything, explain the main mechanism in **Join task records to tag records through a junction table.**. Predict the result for one ordinary input and one boundary input. Record both predictions before checking them.

### Exercise 2 — Guided-to-independent implementation
Rebuild the smallest useful version of the lesson's main mechanism from a blank file. Your implementation must satisfy **Explain how join type affects unmatched rows and why join predicates belong in the correct clause.**. Start with a written data/control-flow sketch, then code, then verify.

### Exercise 3 — Debug and repair
Take your implementation and introduce one realistic defect: wrong boundary, wrong state update, missing cleanup, incorrect error branch, or invalid assumption. Reproduce the failure, classify it, fix it, and add a regression test or evidence step.

### Exercise 4 — Transfer
Change one important constraint from the lesson. Examples: larger input, partial failure, concurrent callers, invalid data, persistence, or a different representation. Explain which invariant survives, which one changes, and why.

### Exercise 5 — Explanation
Write a 150–250 word technical explanation of **Aggregate joined rows with `GROUP BY` and filter groups with `HAVING`.** as if another student must implement it from your explanation. No screenshots; the explanation must stand on its own.

## 5. Problem-solving lab

Model the resource, owner, state transitions, and failure path explicitly. Solve a small concrete case before implementing the general mechanism.

### Problem-solving protocol

1. Restate the problem and constraints.
2. Produce a small concrete example.
3. State the invariant or contract.
4. Write the simplest baseline solution or model.
5. Identify the bottleneck, failure, or repeated work.
6. Improve it only after you can explain the baseline.
7. Verify against a case designed to break the naive solution.

## 6. Coding challenge

### Reporting query

Write a reporting query using joins and aggregation. Validate totals against a manually computed sample and explain duplicate-row effects.

### Acceptance criteria

- The main path works on normal input.
- At least two boundary or invalid cases are tested.
- One failure mode is deliberately reproduced and then fixed.
- The implementation can be explained from a blank page in terms of state and invariants.
- Verification is reproducible from commands recorded in your evidence file.

## 8. Debugging and failure lab

1. Filter a left-joined table in `WHERE` and identify the lost unmatched rows.

2. Move the predicate into `ON` and compare the preserved rows.

3. Create a task with multiple tags and compare raw row count with distinct-task count to expose join multiplication.

4. Reproduce the failure from a clean terminal session and write the smallest change that returns the system to the expected contract.

Rule: never fix a failure by changing multiple unrelated things at once. The objective is diagnosis, not ritual.

## 9. Transfer and design reasoning

Change exactly one constraint in the main case for # 051 — Joins, Aggregation, and Data Processing: change the input shape, data size, interface, or operating condition without changing the underlying objective. Solve it from blank, then verify the new behavior with a terminal command or a reproducible calculation.

Your transfer answer is complete only when the changed constraint is explicit and the evidence distinguishes the new case from the original case.

Then answer: **What would make your current solution wrong even though all visible examples still pass?**

## 10. Academic drill

1. **Formal model:** State the relevant relation, invariant, transaction property, or storage rule.
2. **Schedule/table:** Work one small example manually.
3. **Counterexample:** Construct one invalid or surprising case.
4. **Verification:** State the SQL command, trace, or test that would falsify your answer.

This lesson is also an academic integration point. Do the written drill before the engineering implementation so the two reinforce each other rather than becoming two unrelated memorisation exercises.

## 11. Self-test

- [ ] What does an inner join return?
- [ ] How does a left join preserve unmatched rows?
- [ ] How can a `WHERE` predicate null-reject a left-joined row?
- [ ] What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?
- [ ] How can a many-to-many join multiply counts?
- [ ] When is `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` appropriate?

Score yourself only after the attempt: **0 = cannot answer, 1 = answer with notes, 2 = answer from memory, 3 = answer and justify a new variation.**

## 12. Evidence and grading

Create `EVIDENCE.md` in this lesson directory. Record:

- the exact commands or test commands used;
- one before/after prediction;
- one failure reproduced deliberately and its diagnosis;
- the result of the coding challenge;
- one transfer variation;
- your self-test score.

### Gate rubric

| Dimension | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Knowledge | Explain the core model without notes. |
| Procedure | Produce a working implementation or derivation from blank. |
| Debugging | Reproduce, classify, and repair one realistic failure. |
| Transfer | Solve a changed constraint without being handed the algorithm. |
| Evidence | Another person can reproduce the verification from your notes. |

Suggested pass threshold: all five dimensions pass. If one fails, review that dimension before moving to the next lesson.

## 13. Mastery gate

Use the lecture's mastery gate in [`README.md`](README.md) as the primary criterion. This work packet adds the stronger requirement that you can satisfy the gate **after** completing independent work, not by recognising the lecture examples.

For integrated assessment lessons, the gate is summative: treat the challenge as an exam/project submission and do not consult previous solutions while working.

## 14. Spaced review

- **Next day:** answer the self-test from memory and redo one exercise without looking.
- **One week:** solve the transfer problem again under a changed constraint.
- **Later module review:** revisit this lesson when the concept reappears in a later module and compare the old and new evidence.

## 15. External practice reference

- Use the lesson's assigned material and primary technical documentation when a precise semantic detail needs verification. The repository challenge remains the assessment artifact.
