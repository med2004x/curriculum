# Lesson 024 Work Packet

**Lecture:** [`README.md`](README.md)  
**Module:** 3. Architecture, Linux, Processes, and Concurrency  
**Primary:** Architecture/Linux/C  
**Session target:** 2–4 hours  

This file is the practical half of the lesson. Do the lecture first. Do not treat the worked examples in the lecture as evidence that you can reproduce the skill from memory.

## 1. Session sequence

Use this exact order: **retrieve → guided practice → independent exercises → problem solving → coding challenge → review → evidence**. Skip a phase only when you have already demonstrated mastery of the lesson gate.

Suggested pacing: 10–15 min retrieval, 25–45 min guided practice, 45–75 min exercises, 30–60 min problem solving, 60–120 min challenge, 15 min review.

## 2. Retrieve before learning

1. What does a page table map?
2. What does a TLB cache?
3. How do virtual size and RSS differ?
4. Why can a valid access to a nonresident page fault and still resume?
5. What makes an invalid access different from demand paging?
6. Why are RSS changes approximate and platform-dependent?

Do not open the lecture until the predictions are written. Retrieval is not warm-up decoration. It is part of the lesson.

## 3. Guided practice

### Practice A — Predict
1. Predict whether mapping a large region necessarily makes the entire region resident.
2. Predict how touching one byte on each of several pages affects RSS qualitatively.
3. Predict what a TLB hit avoids compared with a page-table walk.
4. Predict whether a valid but nonresident mapped page must terminate the process.
5. Predict what happens when code accesses an address outside a permitted mapping.
6. Predict why two operating systems may report different RSS changes for the same source program.
7. Distinguish the address-space size from resident memory in your prediction.
8. Record the assumptions about mapping type and page size before interpreting measurements.

Run the smallest case first. Record prediction and observation side by side.

### Practice B — Modify one variable
Take the smallest runnable example from the lecture and change exactly one thing. Do not add new concepts yet. Predict the change, run it, and explain the delta in one paragraph.

### Practice C — Guided instrumentation
Instrument one internal state: an index, pointer, counter, transaction state, request ID, queue length, timestamp, or equivalent. The instrumentation must let you answer “what changed?” rather than merely “did it work?”

## 4. Independent exercises

### Exercise 1 — Recall and prediction
Without running anything, explain the main mechanism in **Explain the purpose of per-process virtual address spaces.**. Predict the result for one ordinary input and one boundary input. Record both predictions before checking them.

### Exercise 2 — Guided-to-independent implementation
Rebuild the smallest useful version of the lesson's main mechanism from a blank file. Your implementation must satisfy **Describe virtual-page to physical-frame translation and the role of page tables and the TLB.**. Start with a written data/control-flow sketch, then code, then verify.

### Exercise 3 — Debug and repair
Take your implementation and introduce one realistic defect: wrong boundary, wrong state update, missing cleanup, incorrect error branch, or invalid assumption. Reproduce the failure, classify it, fix it, and add a regression test or evidence step.

### Exercise 4 — Transfer
Change one important constraint from the lesson. Examples: larger input, partial failure, concurrent callers, invalid data, persistence, or a different representation. Explain which invariant survives, which one changes, and why.

### Exercise 5 — Explanation
Write a 150–250 word technical explanation of **Distinguish reserving or mapping address space from making pages resident by accessing them.** as if another student must implement it from your explanation. No screenshots; the explanation must stand on its own.

## 5. Problem-solving lab

Model the resource, owner, state transitions, and failure path explicitly. Solve a small concrete case before implementing the general mechanism.

### Problem-solving protocol

1. Restate the problem and constraints.
2. Produce a small concrete example.
3. State the invariant or contract.
4. Write the simplest baseline solution or model.
5. Identify the bottleneck, failure, or repeated work.
6. Improve it only after you can explain the baseline.
7. Verify against a case designed to break the naive solution.

## 6. Coding challenge

### Address-space map

Write a small process-memory probe that records stack, heap, static, and mapped regions where observable. Explain virtual addresses versus physical memory.

### Acceptance criteria

- The main path works on normal input.
- At least two boundary or invalid cases are tested.
- One failure mode is deliberately reproduced and then fixed.
- The implementation can be explained from a blank page in terms of state and invariants.
- Verification is reproducible from commands recorded in your evidence file.

## 8. Debugging and failure lab

1. Access an address in a valid mapping that has not yet been touched, then explain how the kernel may service the fault.

2. Attempt an access outside the mapping only as a controlled failure case; distinguish the resulting invalid-access signal from demand paging.

3. Explain the observed metrics in terms of page granularity while noting that allocator, kernel, shared pages, and accounting details can affect the exact values.

4. Reproduce the failure from a clean terminal session and write the smallest change that returns the system to the expected contract.

Rule: never fix a failure by changing multiple unrelated things at once. The objective is diagnosis, not ritual.

## 9. Transfer and design reasoning

Change one constraint: use a file-backed mapping instead of anonymous memory, or change the fraction of pages touched. Explain what remains the same in address translation and what changes in the backing policy.

Your transfer answer is complete only when the changed constraint is explicit and the evidence distinguishes the new case from the original case.

Then answer: **What would make your current solution wrong even though all visible examples still pass?**

## 10. Academic drill

1. **Closed-book definition:** State the key formal definition from this lesson in one or two sentences.
2. **Worked derivation:** Draw the state transition or representation for the concrete example used in the lesson.
3. **Exam variation:** Change one parameter and recompute the result without running code.
4. **Engineering bridge:** Identify the exact observation in the terminal that would confirm your written result.

This lesson is also an academic integration point. Do the written drill before the engineering implementation so the two reinforce each other rather than becoming two unrelated memorisation exercises.

## 11. Self-test

- [ ] What does a page table map?
- [ ] What does a TLB cache?
- [ ] How do virtual size and RSS differ?
- [ ] Why can a valid access to a nonresident page fault and still resume?
- [ ] What makes an invalid access different from demand paging?
- [ ] Why are RSS changes approximate and platform-dependent?

Score yourself only after the attempt: **0 = cannot answer, 1 = answer with notes, 2 = answer from memory, 3 = answer and justify a new variation.**

## 12. Evidence and grading

Create `EVIDENCE.md` in this lesson directory. Record:

- the exact commands or test commands used;
- one before/after prediction;
- one failure reproduced deliberately and its diagnosis;
- the result of the coding challenge;
- one transfer variation;
- your self-test score.

### Gate rubric

| Dimension | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Knowledge | Explain the core model without notes. |
| Procedure | Produce a working implementation or derivation from blank. |
| Debugging | Reproduce, classify, and repair one realistic failure. |
| Transfer | Solve a changed constraint without being handed the algorithm. |
| Evidence | Another person can reproduce the verification from your notes. |

Suggested pass threshold: all five dimensions pass. If one fails, review that dimension before moving to the next lesson.

## 13. Mastery gate

Use the lecture's mastery gate in [`README.md`](README.md) as the primary criterion. This work packet adds the stronger requirement that you can satisfy the gate **after** completing independent work, not by recognising the lecture examples.

For integrated assessment lessons, the gate is summative: treat the challenge as an exam/project submission and do not consult previous solutions while working.

## 14. Spaced review

- **Next day:** answer the self-test from memory and redo one exercise without looking.
- **One week:** solve the transfer problem again under a changed constraint.
- **Later module review:** revisit this lesson when the concept reappears in a later module and compare the old and new evidence.

## 15. External practice reference

- Use the lesson's assigned material and primary technical documentation when a precise semantic detail needs verification. The repository challenge remains the assessment artifact.
