# Lesson 069 Work Packet

**Lecture:** [`README.md`](README.md)  
**Module:** 8. Backend Engineering  
**Primary:** Security/API  
**Session target:** 2–4 hours  

This file is the practical half of the lesson. Do the lecture first. Do not treat the worked examples in the lecture as evidence that you can reproduce the skill from memory.

## 1. Session sequence

Use this exact order: **retrieve → guided practice → independent exercises → problem solving → coding challenge → review → evidence**. Skip a phase only when you have already demonstrated mastery of the lesson gate.

Suggested pacing: 10–15 min retrieval, 25–45 min guided practice, 45–75 min exercises, 30–60 min problem solving, 60–120 min challenge, 15 min review.

## 2. Retrieve before learning

1. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
2. What does a JWT signature establish, and what does it not conceal?
3. Which token claims should a verifier validate besides the signature?
4. Why is a role check insufficient for resource ownership?
5. When might an API use 404 rather than 403 for a denied resource?
6. Why must bearer tokens be protected from logs and plaintext transport?

Do not open the lecture until the predictions are written. Retrieval is not warm-up decoration. It is part of the lesson.

## 3. Guided practice

### Practice A — Predict
1. Predict the result of the smallest lesson-specific case.
2. Predict one boundary case and state exactly which observation would confirm it.
3. Predict the first failure signal if one assumption is broken.
4. Predict which state, file, process, query, or interface is responsible for the observable result.
5. Predict what changes when one constraint is changed and all other inputs stay fixed.
6. Predict the verification command before you run it.
7. Predict one debugging step that would reduce the problem to a smaller case.
8. Write the prediction down before executing any of the cases.

Run the smallest case first. Record prediction and observation side by side.

### Practice B — Modify one variable
Take the smallest runnable example from the lecture and change exactly one thing. Do not add new concepts yet. Predict the change, run it, and explain the delta in one paragraph.

### Practice C — Guided instrumentation
Instrument one internal state: an index, pointer, counter, transaction state, request ID, queue length, timestamp, or equivalent. The instrumentation must let you answer “what changed?” rather than merely “did it work?”

## 4. Independent exercises

### Exercise 1 — Recall and prediction
Without running anything, explain the main mechanism in **Explain the central model of # 069 — Authentication, Authorization, and Threats and name the boundary where it applies.**. Predict the result for one ordinary input and one boundary input. Record both predictions before checking them.

### Exercise 2 — Guided-to-independent implementation
Rebuild the smallest useful version of the lesson's main mechanism from a blank file. Your implementation must satisfy **Trace one concrete case of # 069 — Authentication, Authorization, and Threats before executing it.**. Start with a written data/control-flow sketch, then code, then verify.

### Exercise 3 — Debug and repair
Take your implementation and introduce one realistic defect: wrong boundary, wrong state update, missing cleanup, incorrect error branch, or invalid assumption. Reproduce the failure, classify it, fix it, and add a regression test or evidence step.

### Exercise 4 — Transfer
Change one important constraint from the lesson. Examples: larger input, partial failure, concurrent callers, invalid data, persistence, or a different representation. Explain which invariant survives, which one changes, and why.

### Exercise 5 — Explanation
Write a 150–250 word technical explanation of **Rebuild the core exercise from an empty workspace without copying the reference implementation.** as if another student must implement it from your explanation. No screenshots; the explanation must stand on its own.

## 5. Problem-solving lab

Assume an attacker controls one untrusted input or one lower-trust component. Identify the trust boundary, attacker goal, violated invariant, and smallest preventive control. Verify the control with a test.

### Problem-solving protocol

1. Restate the problem and constraints.
2. Produce a small concrete example.
3. State the invariant or contract.
4. Write the simplest baseline solution or model.
5. Identify the bottleneck, failure, or repeated work.
6. Improve it only after you can explain the baseline.
7. Verify against a case designed to break the naive solution.

## 6. Coding challenge

### AuthN/AuthZ

Implement authenticated access to two resources with distinct permissions. Add tests for anonymous, authenticated-but-forbidden, and authorized requests.

### Acceptance criteria

- The main path works on normal input.
- At least two boundary or invalid cases are tested.
- One failure mode is deliberately reproduced and then fixed.
- The implementation can be explained from a blank page in terms of state and invariants.
- Verification is reproducible from commands recorded in your evidence file.

## 8. Debugging and failure lab

1. Deliberately implement the exact vulnerability described in Learn: an endpoint that checks only the user's role (e.g. "is this user clinic-staff") without checking whether the specific requested resource ID actually belongs to them.

2. Using a real test with two different clinic-staff users (each associated with a different clinic), confirm user A can successfully access user B's clinic's data purely because both share the `clinic-staff` role, despite having no legitimate relationship to each other's clinic.

3. Explain, using this concrete, successfully-reproduced vulnerability, why "the user has the right role" and "the user is allowed to access this specific resource" are genuinely different checks that must both be performed — and why a code review or test suite that only exercises the happy path (a user accessing their *own* resources) would never catch this bu.

4. Reproduce the failure from a clean terminal session and write the smallest change that returns the system to the expected contract.

Rule: never fix a failure by changing multiple unrelated things at once. The objective is diagnosis, not ritual.

## 9. Transfer and design reasoning

Change one authorization rule: introduce a read-only role, or allow an explicit delegated clinic relationship. State how the principal/resource policy changes and add both allowed and denied tests.

Your transfer answer is complete only when the changed constraint is explicit and the evidence distinguishes the new case from the original case.

Then answer: **What would make your current solution wrong even though all visible examples still pass?**

## 10. Academic drill

1. **Contract recall:** State the protocol/API/security rule without notes.
2. **Scenario analysis:** Given one malformed or adversarial request, determine the expected system response.
3. **Why:** Explain the invariant or security property that makes that response correct.
4. **Implementation bridge:** Name the test or runtime observation that would prove the rule is enforced.

This lesson is also an academic integration point. Do the written drill before the engineering implementation so the two reinforce each other rather than becoming two unrelated memorisation exercises.

## 11. Self-test

- [ ] What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- [ ] What does a JWT signature establish, and what does it not conceal?
- [ ] Which token claims should a verifier validate besides the signature?
- [ ] Why is a role check insufficient for resource ownership?
- [ ] When might an API use 404 rather than 403 for a denied resource?
- [ ] Why must bearer tokens be protected from logs and plaintext transport?

Score yourself only after the attempt: **0 = cannot answer, 1 = answer with notes, 2 = answer from memory, 3 = answer and justify a new variation.**

## 12. Evidence and grading

Create `EVIDENCE.md` in this lesson directory. Record:

- the exact commands or test commands used;
- one before/after prediction;
- one failure reproduced deliberately and its diagnosis;
- the result of the coding challenge;
- one transfer variation;
- your self-test score.

### Gate rubric

| Dimension | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Knowledge | Explain the core model without notes. |
| Procedure | Produce a working implementation or derivation from blank. |
| Debugging | Reproduce, classify, and repair one realistic failure. |
| Transfer | Solve a changed constraint without being handed the algorithm. |
| Evidence | Another person can reproduce the verification from your notes. |

Suggested pass threshold: all five dimensions pass. If one fails, review that dimension before moving to the next lesson.

## 13. Mastery gate

Use the lecture's mastery gate in [`README.md`](README.md) as the primary criterion. This work packet adds the stronger requirement that you can satisfy the gate **after** completing independent work, not by recognising the lecture examples.

For integrated assessment lessons, the gate is summative: treat the challenge as an exam/project submission and do not consult previous solutions while working.

## 14. Spaced review

- **Next day:** answer the self-test from memory and redo one exercise without looking.
- **One week:** solve the transfer problem again under a changed constraint.
- **Later module review:** revisit this lesson when the concept reappears in a later module and compare the old and new evidence.

## 15. External practice reference

- Use the lesson's assigned material and primary technical documentation when a precise semantic detail needs verification. The repository challenge remains the assessment artifact.
